	<h2>CNN SUNDAY NIGHT</h2>
	<h4>Interview With Khalid Qazi</h4>
	Aired September 15, 2002 - 22:03 &nbsp; ET
	<table>
		<tr><td>
		<br><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><br>
		     CAROL LIN, CNN ANCHOR:  We begin with the search for more suspects in Buffalo, in that Buffalo terror investigation.  Five New York men are already in a federal detention center tonight, accused of helping al Qaeda.  But also today, we're hearing an insistent defense of these men from their hometown of Lackawanna, New York.  Family and friends could not believe the news and don't believe the government's case against them.<br>     One government sources says they've been investigating the men since before the 9/11 attacks.  Now the FBI moved into arrest them now because of alleged chatter, conversations the men were having recently about a possible attack.  A bond hearing is set for Wednesday.<br> <br>     Now authorities say they are pretty sure three more suspects are still out there somewhere.<br> <br>     CNN's Susan Candiotti literally runs through the ABCs of the investigation.<br> <br>     (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<br> <br>     SUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The five men of Yemeni descent, charged as an al Qaeda trained cell, are not characterized by government sources as appearing less significant in the overall investigation.<br> <br>     MICHAEL BATTLE, U.S. ATTORNEY:  We're not aware that they were awaiting any orders.  What we do know is that they trained in a camp, and that that camp was run by al Qaeda trainers.<br> <br>     CANDIOTTI:  A growing focus is on at least three more men, known only as uncharged co-conspirators A, B, and C.  One in particular, government sources say, bears special watching.  All three used to live in Lackawanna, outside Buffalo.  Like the five in custody, A and B are U.S. citizens.  They are now in Yemen.  C is also outside the U.S., and the one who appears to have put the year long investigation in high gear.<br> <br>     Just last week, as Americans marked the anniversary of September 11, the FBI interviewed C in an unnamed country.  According to an FBI affidavit, C admitted he and some of the accused trained at the al- Faruk al Qaeda camp last year.  That led agents in New York to revisit suspect Sahim Alwan September 12, who according to the FBI, admitted to terrorist training.<br> <br>     PETER AHEARN, FBI SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE:  What prompted these five individuals to do what they did is something that they're going to have to answer for.<br> <br>     CANDIOTTI:  The brother of one suspect, Aibir Mosed, and relatives of others accused, insist the men went overseas for religious training, nothing more.<br> <br>     AIBIR MOSED, SUSPECT'S BROTHER:  He told he was going to learn and some people stay four months.  Then all of a sudden, say come back in a month and a half.  Like what happened?  Like I miss America.  No pizza, no TV.  I eat with my hand.  No spoons.<br> <br>     CANDIOTTI:  Lackawanna, a former thriving steel town that initially attracted a Muslim community 20 years ago, is stunned by the arrests.  All five men went to the local high school.  Samira Saleh used to rent an apartment to one of the accused, Yahya Goba.  She describes him as peaceful.<br> <br>     SAMIRA SALEH, SUSPECT'S LANDLORD:  (UNINTELLIGIBLE) about a year ago.  Very nice man.  Very kind.  I've never seen him do anything suspicious.<br> <br>     CANDIOTTI:  The mosque is a central gathering place.  It's imam trying to coming to terms with the allegations.<br> <br>     Do you think it's possible that they might have been involved in terrorists providing support to al Qaeda?<br> <br>     AROB WAHAB ZIAD, LACKAWANNA ISLAMIC MOSQUE:  No.<br> <br>     CANDIOTTI:  Right here in Lackawanna?<br> <br>     ZIAD:  No.  Nobody support al Qaeda here in my community.  Nobody support al Qaeda in this community because we -- we agonize what happened.<br> <br>     (END VIDEOTAPE)<br> <br>     CANDIOTTI:  As investigators look more closely at conspirators A, B and especially C, the people who know their identities right here where they used to live will say no more about them, at least for now -- Carol.<br> <br>     LIN:  Susan, has the government been more specific though about what evidence they have against these men?<br> <br>     CANDIOTTI:  Well according to the FBI, those five men did travel to Afghanistan and then return to the U.S.  But even the FBI acknowledges it doesn't exactly what they were up to, and won't even call them a sleeper cell, which raises even more questions about these uncharged conspirators that we've been hearing about.  There is going to be a hearing later on this week.  So perhaps we'll learn more about them.<br> <br>     LIN:  That would be Wednesday.  Thank you very much.  Susan Candiotti reporting live from Buffalo.<br> <br>     We are hearing more about the five men, of course, and why so many of their neighborhood are defending them.  For example, one of the men, who allegedly went through heavy weapons training in Afghanistan, is described as a father of three and a professional counselor to troubled teenagers.  Tonight, we invited a man who knows three of the suspects.  Khalid Qazi of the American Muslim Council joins us now from Buffalo.<br> <br>     Good evening, sir.  Thanks for joining us.<br> <br>     KHALID QAZI, AMERICAN MUSLIM COUNCIL:  Good evening, thanks for having me.<br> <br>     LIN:  What more can you tell us about the three men that you know?<br> <br>     QAZI:  Well, I can tell you that these are average Americans that you would see on the street anywhere else.  These are born and bred Americans, gone to the school here and raised in normal surroundings and talking about American way of life all the time, movies and going to parties and picnics like everybody else.  And I can't tell you how shocked everybody is about these alleged charges with these five individuals and the three ones that I know.<br> <br>     LIN:  But Mr. Qazi, why would normal average Americans go to Afghanistan and go through weapons training with al Qaeda?<br> <br>     QAZI:  I guess that's the question that everybody is going to wait for and want to know.  As far as I'm concerned, and as far as the community is concerned, we haven't seen anything yet that would convince anybody of the crimes that are alleged to have been committed by these young men.  And we will see where we go with the investigation, and what sort of an evidence is put forward.<br> <br>     LIN:  Mr. Qazi, what evidence would you -- would convince you that these five men were working on behalf of al Qaeda?<br> <br>     QAZI:  I think any evidence that would convince any other average American would certainly convince me.  And that would include the training whereabouts, where they went, how they spent their time, who they associated with, what they did when they were associated with those camps, and if they had any idea or knowledge of September 11, or if they had knowledge of any other attacks that al Qaeda was proposing or was planning to have against our national interests.<br> <br>     LIN:  But Mr. Qazi, why isn't it enough for you to hear from the governor of New York, the special agent in charge of the FBI, the U.S. attorney's office, all of whom say that they have been investigating all five men for the better part of a year now?<br> <br>     QAZI:  Well, the reason is that these five individuals have been talking to FBI for number of months.  And I know some of them, even before September 11.  They haven't run away anywhere.  They haven't been hiding any place.  They have been communicating with the FBI at free will.  And in fact, one of them that you were talking about even went for the holy pilgrimage with the knowledge of FBI after September 11.     So we haven't seen anything so far that would convince every average person of the crimes that they are suspected to have been associated with.<br> <br>     LIN:  Well, then why do you think the authorities are going after these five men then?<br> <br>     QAZI:  I think that's the evidence we all, all Americans are going to wait for.  And I will -- I attended the initial part of the hearing last Saturday, actually yesterday morning -- yesterday afternoon.  And the judge was very clear that all the five suspects are totally innocent, unless they are proven of any guilt.  And that is what we are all waiting for, to see what the evidence is that will prove or disprove that guilt.<br> <br>     LIN:  All right, thank you very much, Khalid Qazi with the American Muslim Council.  Of course, the FBI has gone out of its way to say that members of the Muslim community have been extremely helpful in this investigation.  And in fact, one, if not some, actually tipped off authorities.<br> <br>TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT www.fdch.com<br> <br><Byline: Carol Lin, Susan Candiotti> <Guest: Khalid Qazi> <High: Five New York men are in a federal detention center tonight, accused of helping al Qaeda.
